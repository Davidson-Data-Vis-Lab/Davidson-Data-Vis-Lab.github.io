Edit the title (above) and the author name to be your name. 

You can add images like this:

![Alt text describing the image](./images/lab-logo.png)

Be sure that filenames don't contain any spaces. This makes
linking to files easier (e.g. use `lag-logo.png` instead of `lab logo.png`).



Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
